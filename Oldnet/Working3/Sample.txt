Churros (makes about 2 dozen)
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1 pinch salt
1 Tbs. sugar
1 cup flour
1 egg, cracked into a cup with a pour spout
oil for frying, such as canola or grapeseed (something that wonâ€™t smoke at high temperatures)
1 cup sugar combined with 1 tsp. cinnamon 

    Combine the milk, water, pinch of salt and tablespoon of sugar in a pot and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the flour all at once and stir like crazy with a wooden spoon. The mixture will come together in a ball. Lower the heat and continue stirring for a few minutes to cook the flour. 

    Turn the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer and begin to beat it with the paddle attachment at low speed. Pour in the egg and continue mixing until it is completely incorporated. 

    Put half the dough into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2 inch star tip and set aside, cover the remaining dough with plastic wrap.

    Put a heavy pot over medium high heat and let it warm for a minute, then pour in at least an inch of oil (2 inches, if you have enough oil). When the oil is shimmering and looks hot, squeeze in a small bit of the batter from the pastry bag. If bubbles come up around it and the dough begins to puff and brown on the bottom, the oil is hot enough.
