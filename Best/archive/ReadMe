To run the server and client, open cse01 and cse02.
On cse01, run the server by typing "./server"

On cse02, run the client by typing "./client"

There is a 1KB file called "Sample.txt". This file gets transmitted to the server.
After both programs are run, a new file "recipe.txt" is created by the server. Inside are the contents of Sample.txt

Another file, “list.txt” is also created. This file contains the TCP header segments.
